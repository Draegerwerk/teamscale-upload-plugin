Good work :) I left some comments inline, mostly some style suggestions, as well as the points below. Feel free to talk to me in person if anything is unclear. 
- Please commit .idea folder and add files specific to local setup to .gitignore (c.f. [here](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544839-How-to-manage-projects-under-Version-Control-Systems)). This makes it easier to set up the project for the first time as we can open instead of import the project in IntelliJ, which is much easier.
- It'd be great if you could add documentation how to let the plugin run for the first time
- Also, please split documentation into user and developer documentation, similar to the JaCoCo agent project (as discussed in person)
- An, as also already discussed, please have a look at the [Teamscale findings](https://demo.teamscale.com/findings.html#/teamscale-jenkins-plugin/?) ;)
